Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```javascript
// At the very end of the file, add:
}
```

The file was only missing one closing curly brace `}` at the very end to close the `Friends` component function. The rest of the brackets were properly matched.

The complete file structure is:

1. Import statements
2. Interface definitions
3. `export function Friends() {`
4. Component implementation 
5. `return (` with JSX
6. `);` closing the return
7. `}` closing the Friends function

I've added the final missing `}` to properly close the `Friends` component function. The file should now be syntactically complete.
